I've just counted - I've been basically trying an [experiment to become a morning person](http://studio36.lt/blog/a-little-sleep-and-scheduling-experiment/ "A little sleep and scheduling experiment") and fit the schedule for three months now. Turns out it's not that easy.<!--more-->

The plan was to start waking up early, around 06:30 AM and go to the gym or start working on side projects, like this blog, Wordpress theme or a [framework](https://github.com/mbardauskas/builder-framework). I did some work, but I consider it to be too little. I've also had some rules which were supposed to be helping me. Here's the list of them and the outcome which usually happened:

1.  _never stay up longer than 2:00 AM on weekends_ -- this one is not easily achieved when alcohol is in the equation.
2.  _wake up at least at 8:00 AM on weekends --_ that did not happen even once. I guess 10:00 AM should be my bet.
3.  _no PC after 10:00 PM_ -- it's already past 10:00 PM and I'm writing this post.
4.  _have an optional [power nap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_nap) between 12 pm and 3 pm_ -- strangely enough, I've done this only few times, 2-4 I guess, probably because of the boost of energy for the day after morning workout.

### Conclusions

If I were to retry the experiment, here's what I should do differently:

1.  Have the rules above the bed and see them every day.
2.  Keep a journal of the experiment, preferably a digital one, which should be filled up in the mornings. The screen time in the morning should also help to wake up.
3.  Each week review the results and try to optimize your time.
4.  Update the rule list constantly.
Mainly, I've failed at this experiment. But there are always a bright side - I've started doing some things which I've mentioned above, though I'm not too happy with the progress. Also, going to the gym or working out in the morning became more or less a regular thing, which is pretty neat. Lastly, I'm waking up earlier though not that much that I would like to. And why am I not doing this once more?
